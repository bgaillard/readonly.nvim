*readonly.nvim* Secure edition of files containing sensitive information.

Author: Baptiste Gaillard


==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                           *readonly-introduction*

`readonly.nvim` is a plugin to secure edition of files containing sensitive 
information (passwords, API keys, private keys, etc.).

You cannot guarantee all your Neovim plugins are 100% secured and do not leak
sensitive information.

So do not open your secure file under your standard `nvim` setup!


==============================================================================
GOAL                                                           *readonly-goal*

Suppose you configured Github Copilot in your Neovim install and you edit an
SSH private key file.

Are you 100% sure your SSH keys are not sent to Github?

Is it reasonable to have a blind trust with Github privacy? What if the privacy
changes over time and is relaxed? What if a Github employee inserts a bug in
the Copilot source code which leads to an accidental retention of Prompts? What
about a data leak at Github? A hacker succeeding to steal data on the fly?

What about other plugins you installed and are testing? Are you sure they'll
not send sensitive information remotely when you enter stuffs in your Neovim
buffers?

The `readonly.nvim` plugin helps to not worry about secure data leaks by marking
specific files as "sensitive". When you try to open those files they are opened
using a read only mode by default and an error is displayed to indicate you to
edit the file using a very basic editor (or editor command) instead.


==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                           *readonly-requirements*

`reaonly.nvim` only requires Neovim `>= 0.11.0` by default.

If you want to use the notification display mode you also need the 
|https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify| plugin.


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                         *readonly-usage*

Suppose you would like to protect the following sensitive files.

  - `~/.aws/config`
  - `~/.aws/credentials`
  - `~/.ssh/*`
  - `~/.secrets.yaml`
  - `~/.vault-crypt-files/*`

The following configures the plugin with the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager (you
can obviously use any plygin manager you like).
>lua
  return {
    "bgaillard/readonly.nvim",
    opts = {
      pattern = {
        vim.fn.expand("~") .. "/.aws/config",
        vim.fn.expand("~") .. "/.aws/credentials",
        vim.fn.expand("~") .. "/.ssh/*",
        vim.fn.expand("~") .. "/.secrets.yaml",
        vim.fn.expand("~") .. "/.vault-crypt-files/*",
      }
    },
    lazy = false
  }
<

After configuration of the plugin opening the `~/.aws/config` file will
perform the following actions.

  - Set the file with the 'readonly' option equals to `true`
  - Set the file with the 'modifiable' option equals to `false`
  - Display a red message in the command line which indicates that the file
    is secure and must be opened with `nvim -u NONE ~/.aws/config`


==============================================================================
PATTERN MATCHING                                   *readonly-pattern-matching*

The `pattern` option is used to configure the secured files, it can be a
string or a table of strings.

The `pattern` option is passed to the |nvim_create_autocmd| Neovim function
internaly. You'll find the complete documentation of patterns in the
|autocmd-patterns| section of the Neovim documentation.

Be careful, as explained in the Neovim documentation the 'pattern' option is
not automatically expanded (unlike with |:autocmd|). Thus names like `$HOME`
or `~` must be expanded explicitely (with the |vim.fn.expand()| function for
example).


==============================================================================
DISPLAY MODES                                         *readonly-display-modes*

The plugin supports three different display modes which are documented in the 
following sections.

By default only the COMMAND LINE display mode is enabled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUFFER                                               *readonly-display-buffer*

The `buffer` mode is the most secured one because it completely prevents the
files to be read.

As a result any plugin which could read the file and send it's content (or a 
part of it) remotely will never be able to do so.

When this mode is enabled opening a file displays the following message in the
buffer.
>
  This file is marked as secured, you cannot edit it with a Neovim instance 
  having plugins loaded.

  Instead use the following command to edit it securely.

    nvim -u NONE /path/to/the/file
<
To enable this mode just use the `display_modes.buffer` option in the plugin as
follows.
>lua
  return {
    "bgaillard/readonly.nvim",
    opts = {
      display_modes = {
        buffer = {
          enabled = true,
        }
      },
      pattern = {
        "/path/to/the/file",
      }
    },
    lazy = false
  }


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND LINE                                   *readonly-display-command-line*

The `command_line` mode is the default mode of the plugin.

When this mode is enabled opening a file displays the following message in red
in the Neovim command line.
>
  Secured file, open it with `nvim -u NONE /path/to/the/file`
<
TO enable this mode just use the `display_modes.command_line` option in the
plugin as follows.
>lua
  return {
    "bgaillard/readonly.nvim",
    opts = {
      display_modes = {
        command_line = {
          enabled = true,
        }
      },
      pattern = {
        "/path/to/the/file",
      }
    },
    lazy = false
  }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTIFICATION                                   *readonly-display-notification*

The `notification` mode allows to use a specific notification plugin to
display the following message when a secured file is opened.

>
  This file is marked as secured, you cannot edit it with a Neovim instance 
  having plugins loaded.

  Instead use the following command to edit it securely.

    nvim -u NONE /path/to/the/file
<

To enable this mode just use the `display_modes.notification` option in the 
plugin as follows.

>lua
  return {
    "bgaillard/readonly.nvim",
    dependencies = {
      "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- Required for the notification display mode
    },
    opts = {
      display_modes = {
        notification = {
          enabled = true
        }
      },
      pattern = {
        "/path/to/the/file",
      }
    },
    lazy = false
  }

For now the plugin only supports the |https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify| notification plugin.
